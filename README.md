# Unidata ncWMS Code Repository

This ncWMS code repository is used for building the subset of [ncWMS]
used by the THREDDS Data Server ([TDS]).
It both tracks the main ncWMS subversion repository
(svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/ncwms)(browsable [here][ncWMS_repo_browse] and on
[Trac][ncWMS_repo_browse_trac]), or at least the main milestones in that
repository, and any changes or additions needed for integration in the TDS.

The THREDDS team and the ncWMS team work closely (and with the larger
ncWMS community) to ensure that changes are shared as appropriate.
